# If a game of Tic Tac Toe is represented as a list of lists, like so:
#
# game = [[1, 2, 0],
# 	[2, 1, 0],
# 	[2, 1, 1]]
# where a 0 means an empty square, a 1 means that player 1 put their token in that space, and a 2 means that player 2
# put their token in that space.
#
# Your task this week: given a 3 by 3 list of lists that represents a Tic Tac Toe game board, tell me whether anyone
# has won, and tell me which player won, if any. A Tic Tac Toe win is 3 in a row - either in a row, a column, or
# a diagonal. Donâ€™t worry about the case where TWO people have won - assume that in every board there will only be
# one winner.
