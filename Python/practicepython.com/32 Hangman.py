# In this exercise, we will finish building Hangman. In the game of Hangman, the player only has 6 incorrect guesses
# (head, body, 2 legs, and 2 arms) before they lose the game.
#
# In Part 1, we loaded a random word list and picked a word from it. In Part 2, we wrote the logic for guessing the
# letter and displaying that information to the user. In this exercise, we have to put it all together and add logic
# for handling guesses.
#
# Copy your code from Parts 1 and 2 into a new file as a starting point. Now add the following features:
#
# Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left.
# Keep track of the letters the user guessed. If the user guesses a letter they already guessed, donâ€™t penalize
# them - let them guess again.
