# In this exercise, use the bokeh Python library to plot a histogram of which months the scientists have birthdays in!
# Because it would take a long time for you to input the months of various scientists, you can use my scientist birthday
# JSON file. Just parse out the months (if you donâ€™t know how, I suggest looking at the previous exercise or its
# solution) and draw your histogram.
