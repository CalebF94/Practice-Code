"""
*INHERITANCE*

Modelling Classes in Python
    - Large projects often have many class
    - Classes are often related in some way
        - one class may be similar, but with small modifications
    - Many classes can cause some issues:
        - Copy and pasting can cause headaches when you need to make modifictians

Inheritance:
    - INheritance models an "is a" relationship
        - Apple "is a" fruit
        - Fish "is a" food and an animal (Multiple inheritance)
    - Notice this relationship doesn't work the other way
        - all apples are fruit, not all fruits are animals
        - apples are a subgroup of fruit
