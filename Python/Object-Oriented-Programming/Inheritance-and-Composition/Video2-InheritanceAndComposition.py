"""
*INHERITANCE AND COMPOSITION

These are two different techniques to write code that modify classes to write code that is
more extensible (easily changed without rewriting entire code base).

Inheritance:
    - Identifying the common attributes and behaviors
    - some classes will share attributes and methods or with slight modifictions

Composition:
    - How are objects in the real world composed of one another
    - Attribute types can move beyond the primitive to types that we define ourselves
