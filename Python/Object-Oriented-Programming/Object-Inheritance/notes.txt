    1) Object
        - An object is a way of grouping data and methods on the data together
        - Objects often map to things  in the real world
            - Person: name, address, add_to_course()
            - Balance Sheet: assets[], liabilities[]
        - A class defines an object

        A class is created using the keyword class followed by the class name. By
        convention the class name is capitalized
            class Square:
