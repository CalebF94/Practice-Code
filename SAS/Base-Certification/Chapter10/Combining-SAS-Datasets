Concatenating Data sets example  
*/

/*
Basic Match-Merging Example  
*/

*First the data sets need to be sorted based on the BY variable;

* Data contains patient information such as patient id, age, sex, and Date;
PROC SORT data=cert.demog;
	by id;
RUN;

* Data contains patient visit details such as patient id, visit number, 
	SysBP, DiasBP, Weight, and Date of visit;
PROC SORT data=cert.visit;
	by id;
RUN;

*Merging the data sets. Notice both data sets have a date column. This value is populated with
the value of the second data set (cert.visit);
data work.merged;
	merge cert.demog cert.visit;
	by id;
RUN;

PROC PRINT data=work.merged;
RUN;


/*
Merge in Descending Order

Pretty similar to the previous example
Added DESCENDING statements to all BY statements  
*/
PROC SORT data=cert.demog;
	BY DESCENDING id;
RUN;

PROC SORT data=cert.visit;
	BY DESCENDING id;
RUN;

DATA work.merged;
	MERGE cert.demog cert.visit;
	BY DESCENDING ID;
RUN;

PROC PRINT data=work.merged;
RUN;
